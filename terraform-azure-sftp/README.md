# terraform-azure-sftp

An infrastructure classic. Now for the CLOUD!

## Why
Legacy services that need data from cloud solutions cannot speak API. So we needed a solution that can speak SFTP.
Luckily it never has been easier with terraform and azure default services.

## How
Creates a container based sftp service that links to a storage file share in azure.
